        <h2>THE MYSTERY HOUSE</h2>
        <img id="casa" src="../imagenes/casa.jpg">
        <p>In a small village there was an abandoned house on which many stories were told. One Halloween day, four friends (Raul, Fran, Carolina and Lorena) went to inspect the house, but before they enter they heard a scream and they decided to leave. At night, when they where ordering candies, they kept asking between them who could have been in that place and decided to approach again. It wasn't yet 12 o'clock at night, but when they arrive they felt a chill. They entered and when they were walking, a porcelain doll fell in their path. It didn't fright them and they continue wolking. They found two chairs in front of a fireplace where there was a candle and a music box that turn on from nothing and began to sound. </p>
        <p>Afraid, they looked for a way out, but some shadows reached them and they understood everything. They could see a girl of about eleven years playing the ouija while her parents were down caressing her brother, a little baby. In what seemed like an impulse, she took an ax and went down to the room where she killed her parents and brother. The four children understood that the girl was jealous of the attention stolen. When they tried to leave, they say that the Infanta cursed them, and since then, each Halloween night, Raul, Fran, Carolina and Lorraine have to visit that house and spend hours "playing" with the spirit.</p>
